# Bits Bites
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. The program simulates an order for different products, and calculates them using various offers.

*In "UebungPolymorphie.pdf" are the instructions for the project.*

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Bits & Bites.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
